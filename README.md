# RSBI_Android

Work in progress:
- functionality
- design architecture: documentation, diagrams
- Fragment mock-ups
- database models
- testing
- deployment, scripts for testing and compiling from a cloned repository (without necessarily using Android Studio)

Formalities:
- the stable / unstable tags and the versioning in README.md
- every ("significant") feature has its own branch, then is pulled on the "dev(elopment)" master branch
